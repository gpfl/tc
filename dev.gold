6965	v & h is a system of coordinates ( v and h ) for describing locations of rate centers in the united states . the projection , devi sed by j . k . don ald , is an " elliptical , " or " doubly equi distant " projection , scaled down by a factor of 0 . 003 to balance errors . the foc i of the projection , from which distances are measured accurately ( except for the scale correction ) , are at 37 d 42 m 14 . 69 s n , 8 2d 39 m 15 . 27 s w ( in flo yd co . , ky . ) and 4 1d 02 m 55 . 53 s n , 112 d 03 m 39 . 35 w ( in web ster co . , ut ah ) . they are just 0 . 4 radians apart . here is the transformation from latitude and longitude to v & h : first project the earth from its ellipso idal surface to a sphere . this alters the latitude ; the coefficients bi in the program are the coefficients of the polynomial approximation for the inverse transformation . ( the function is odd , so the coefficients are for the linear term , the cubic term , and so on . ) also subtract 52 degrees from the longitude . for the rest , compute the arc distances of the given point to the reference points , and transform them to the coordinate system in which the line through the reference points is the x - axis and the origin is the eastern reference point . the solution is h = ( square of distance to e - square of distance to w + square of distance between e and w ) / twice distance between e and w ; v = square root of absolute value of ( square of distance to e - square of h ) . reduce by three - ten ths of a percent , rotate by 76 . 59 74 97 degrees , and add 63 63 . 235 to v and 2 250 . 7 to h . to go the other way , as this program does , undo the final translation , rotation , and scaling . the z - value pz of the point on the x - y - z sphere satisfies the quadratic az z + bz + c = 0 , where a = ( ex w z - ez wx ) ^ 2 + ( ey w z x - ez w y ) ^ 2 + ( ex w y - ey wx ) ^ 2 ; b = - 2 [ ( ex cos ( arc to w ) - wx cos ( arc to e ) ) ( ex w z - ez wx ) - ( ey cos ( arc to w ) - w y cos ( arc to e ) ) ( ey w z - ez w y ) ] ; c = ( ex cos ( arc to w ) - wx cos ( arc to e ) ) ^ 2 + ( ey cos ( arc to w ) - w y cos ( arc to e ) ) ^ 2 - ( ex w y - ey wx ) ^ 2 . solve with the quadratic formula . the latitude is simply the arc sine of pz . px and py satisfy exp x + e ypy + ez pz = cos ( arc to e ) ; wx px + w ypy + w z pz = cos ( arc to w ) . substitute pz ' s value , and solve linearly to get px and py . the longitude is the arc tangent of px / py . finally , this latitude and longitude are spherical ; use the inverse polynomial approximation on the latitude to get the ellipso idal earth latitude , and add 52 degrees to the longitude .

7285	this method deals with the fact , that the decoding process doesn ' t always yield a single most likely value . the current error correction implementation doesn ' t deal with er as ures very well , so it ' s better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure . the problem is that we don ' t know which of the ambiguous values to choose . we try decode using the first value , and if that fails , we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again . this usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes , so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this .
